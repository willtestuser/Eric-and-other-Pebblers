Hi guys!

Just thought I'd provide a brief description about what each repository is. The "AFS-Lemoore" repository is the website
I developed for Armed Forces Storage, and "TheProject" is a website I've been independently building. I rarely use 
GitHub, as I am slightly wary of allowing anyone to see certain aspects of my code -- especially since I am currently 
developing it by myself and don't have too much extra need to be on GitHub. Anyway, please feel free to ask me any questions
on this page if you'd like. Best, Will. 




Test Question?
