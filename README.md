Hi guys!

Just thought I'd provide a brief description about what each repository is. The "AFS-Lemoore" repository is the website
I developed for Armed Forces Storage, and "TheProject" is a project I've been independently building. I rarely use 
GitHub, as I am slightly wary of allowing anyone to see certain aspects of my code -- especially since I am currently 
developing it by myself and don't have too much extra need to be on GitHub. Anyway, feel free to ask me questions on this
page if you'd like, and
